# Welcome to Our E-Commerce Project! 🛍️

Hey there! This is a complete e-commerce solution with React frontend and Node.js backend. Let me walk you through it like I would explain to a friend.

## What's Inside? 🗂️

```

## Let's Get You Set Up! ⚙️

### Backend Setup (The Brains)

1. First, pop into the server folder:

```bash
cd server
```

2. Time to get all the required packages:

```bash
npm install express cors mongoose jsonwebtoken bcryptjs razorpay
```

(Think of this like getting all ingredients before cooking)

3. Create a `.env` file - this is where you'll store your secret keys:

- MongoDB connection string
- JWT secret for authentication
- Razorpay API keys

4. Fire up the server:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Frontend Setup (The Beauty)

1. Hop over to the client side:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Grab the frontend goodies:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom axios react-bootstrap
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
